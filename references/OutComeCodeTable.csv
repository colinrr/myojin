invalidEffusive,-1,11,"Invalid effusive, non-physical","Effusive eruption was overpressured beyond tolerance at the vent."
invalidIntrusive,-2,10,"Invalid stalled/intrusive","No fragmentation occurred, and pressure reached surface value far below the vent. Taken as invalid, but could be considered intrusive."
invalidFragStalled,-3,9,"Invalid fragmenting - stalled","Fragmentation occurred, but pressure reached surface value too far below the vent and integration stopped. Taken as invalid."
